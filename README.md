connect 4 game in GUI in java 
basically this project depends on the using of GUI components .

so here is the list of the used components : 
1- JFrame 
2- JLabel 
3- JTextFeild 
4- JButton
5- Icons and Images 
6- Events and their handlers
7- Color and Fonts 

-- Also I have used some of the abstract classes for event handling such as actionPerformed function
